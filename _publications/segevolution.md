excerpt: 'This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for Neural Information
Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a reproducible, end-to-end framework for
generating training data using large language models (LLMs). We first assess the
reproducibility of the original InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact
benchmark and validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator
models. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:(1) fine …'

Co-authored a project to evaluate the transferability of SegVol, a 3D SAM-based segmentation foundation model, across different medical imaging modalities (CT and MRI). We extended SegVol’s capabilities through LoRA fine-tuning and context-priors (Gao et al., 2023), improving segmentation scores with both approaches.
