## Overview

Co-authored a method improving upon the InPars framework for information retrieval. We augment generation using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and preference fine-tuning to improve downstream performance in diverse information retrieval tasks.

## Key Contributions

- Enhanced synthetic data generation pipeline
- Integration of CoT reasoning for better query generation
- Preference fine-tuning for improved retrieval performance
- Evaluation across multiple IR benchmarks

## Technologies Used

- Python, PyTorch
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Information Retrieval frameworks

## Impact

This work demonstrates significant improvements in synthetic data quality for training IR systems, potentially reducing the need for large-scale human-annotated datasets.
